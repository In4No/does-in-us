Full text of "List of Unidentified Decedents in the United States without DNA on File or Samples Available"

Disclaimer: Some links may contain post-mortem photographs. Please use discretion. In addition,
what is written below may disturb some. Please use caution when proceeding.

This is a list of every known Doe in the United States with no DNA on file, and/or any samples
available. The presented information may be outdated, so if you know of any updates to these cases,
please send me an email in the contact page so I can update it.

It is sectioned alphabetically by state, and then formatted by order of Doe Network/NAMUS
fding numbers, location found, cause of death, unique circumstances/other notes, followed by the year
found and Doe Network and NAMUS links, in order of oldest to most recent cases. Not all of those
listed adhere to these parameters, as some of these profiles did not have adequate information, and
many Does listed do not have NAMUS profiles. Please note that while many of those listed here may
have DNA available, the data that this list is working from may not have been up to date with this
information. Subjects where tests are not complete or samples are not submitted are also listed.
